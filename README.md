<h3 id="pre-requisitos">Prerequisites</h3>

If you want to fork the project and play around, read bellow: 

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Besides, it's good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
or [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

if you want to run the app in your machine, follow the steps above:

- Clone the repository:

<code>git clone https://github.com/TiagoAraujoDev/closeApp.git</code>

- Change to the repository folder, install the dependencies and run the script to run the application locally:

<code>cd closeApp</code>

<code>npm install</code>

<code>npm run dev</code>

<h3 id="objetivo">üéØ Goals</h3>

- I love to watch movies and series, so what's better than building your own site to check movie information, add to watchlist, and favorite them? That's why I decided to build an application that works similarly to IMDB.- The main proporse here was to use a third part API(TMDB), so I dive hard into their documentation.
- When I built this project, the React team had just finished their new documentation. In the documentation, they advised starting the project with a framework, and I decided to go with [Next.js](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs).
- In this project I used some libs. 
    - React query
    - Axios
    - Radix-ui
    - tailwindcss
- The project was deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

<h3 id="tecnologias">üõ† technologies</h3>

The following tools were used to build the project:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ReactJS](https://www.reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs)
